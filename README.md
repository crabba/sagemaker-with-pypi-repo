# sagemaker-with-pypi-repo

A CloudFormation template for a SageMaker instance to be added to Service Catalog.  It includes the [add-pypi-repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-notebook-instance-lifecycle-config-samples/tree/master/scripts/add-pypi-repository) script from [SageMaker Notebook Instance Lifecycle Config Samples](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-notebook-instance-lifecycle-config-samples) in the `BasicNotebookInstanceLifecycleConfig`.  

Currently, the URL of the PyPi repository is hard-coded into this script.
